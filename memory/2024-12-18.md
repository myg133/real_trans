# 2024-12-18 - Real-time Translation System Development

## Progress Made
- Successfully implemented audio simulation testing framework for the real-time translation system
- Created AudioSimulationTester module to simulate real-world audio input/output scenarios
- Fixed various import and type issues in the test framework
- Added proper error handling for audio file processing

## Key Components
- AudioSimulationTester: Handles monitoring of source and target input/output directories
- AudioSimulationConfig: Configuration for test parameters including language settings and directory paths
- Integration with the BidirectionalTranslator and AppContext systems

## Issues Resolved
- Fixed import issues with relative paths (using `crate::` instead of `real_trans::`)
- Replaced chrono dependency with std::time::SystemTime for timestamp generation
- Fixed missing methods in AppContext for translation handling
- Addressed error handling in async file operations

## Next Steps
- Continue refining the real-time translation pipeline
- Improve audio processing components
- Enhance the virtual audio manager functionality
- Conduct more comprehensive testing with simulated audio scenarios
